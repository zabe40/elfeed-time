CAUTION: This package is still under development, breaking changes are very possible.
** Introduction
elfeed-time displays the approximate time it will take to read, watch, or listen to an [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/][elfeed]] entry. It can display this information in both ~elfeed-search-mode~, and ~elfeed-show-mode~.

** Technical Limitations
 * I haven't figured out a good way to determine how long it takes to read webcomics. Perhaps sort them into webcomics that publish chapters VS pages at a time? Or maybe try to measure it's length in inches and have a variable for inches per second?
 * Newsletters pose a similar problem, since they can have many links, and it's impossible to know which set of links you'll follow.
 * yt-dlp currently doesn't have a way to access the localized title of a video, see [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/387][this issue]].
** Epistemological Limitations
elfeed-time cannot account for time spent pondering, note-taking, cross-referencing, rereading, grappling with, examining, or otherwise thinking about entries.
