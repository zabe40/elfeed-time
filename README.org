** Technical Limitations
 * I haven't figured out a good way to determine how long it takes to read webcomics. Perhaps sort them into webcomics that publish chapters VS pages at a time?
 * Newsletters pose a similar problem, since they can have many links, and it's impossible to know which set of links you'll follow.
** Epistemological Limitations
elfeed-time cannot account for time spent pondering, note-taking, cross-referencing, rereading, grappling with, examining, or otherwise thinking about entries.
