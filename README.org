* elfeed-time
CAUTION: This package is still under development, breaking changes are very possible.
** Introduction
elfeed-time displays the approximate time it will take to read, watch, or listen to an [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/][elfeed]] entry. It can display this information in both ~elfeed-search-mode~, and ~elfeed-show-mode~.

*** Features
elfeed-time can measure the length of:
 * Youtube videos
 * Youtube premieres
 * podcasts
 * and of course text (including feeds that only give a preview)
** Installation
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package '(elfeed-time :type git :host github :repo "zabe40/elfeed-time"))
#+end_src
*** Optional dependencies
1. [[https://curl.se/][curl]]
2. One of: [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]], [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]], or [[https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc][yt-dlc]]
3. [[https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html][ffprobe]]
** Configuration
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'elfeed-time)
#+end_src
*** Strongly Recommended
This advice is needed because elfeed doesn't currently have a way to tell it's garbage collector about the elfeed-refs we create with ~elfeed-time-maybe-get-video-info~ and ~elfeed-time-maybe-get-full-content~. Without the advice, the refs in the ~:et-content~ meta slot would be deleted by ~elfeed-db-gc~. For more information see [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/issues/376][this issue]], and [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/pull/457][this pull request]].
  #+begin_src elisp
  (advice-add 'elfeed-db-gc :override #'elfeed-time-db-gc-trace-meta)
#+end_src
*** Recommended
#+begin_src elisp
  (setf elfeed-show-refresh-function elfeed-time-refresh-mail-style-function)
  (setf elfeed-search-print-entry-function #'elfeed-time-search-print-entry)
  (add-hook elfeed-new-entry-hook #'elfeed-time-new-entry 80)
#+end_src
*** Add what you need
For example, if you don't subscribe to any podcasts with elfeed, you won't need to add ~elfeed-time-maybe-get-podcast-info~ to ~elfeed-time-new-entry-functions~.
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook
	    (elfeed-make-tagger :feed-url (rx "youtube.com")
				:add '(video)))

  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-maybe-get-video-info 10)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-maybe-get-premiere-info 20)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-maybe-get-podcast-info 30)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-maybe-get-full-content 40)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-maybe-make-entry-readable 50)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-new-entry-functions #'elfeed-time-count-entry-words 60)

  (add-hook elfeed-time-entry-time-functions #'elfeed-time-video-time 10)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-entry-time-functions #'elfeed-time-premiere-time 20)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-entry-time-functions #'elfeed-time-podcast-time 30)
  (add-hook elfeed-time-entry-time-functions #'elfeed-time-text-time 40)
#+end_src
*** Preferences
#+begin_src elisp
  (setf elfeed-time-reading-speed 250)
  (setf elfeed-time-ignore-private-videos t)
  (setf elfeed-time-update-entries-after-hook-p t)

  (setf elfeed-search-sort-function #'elfeed-time-compare-entries)
  (setf elfeed-sort-order 'ascending)
#+end_src
elfeed-time can also account for the fact that you might play some of your videos and podcasts at 2x speed. Just set that feed's speed by calling the function ~elfeed-time-set-feed-speed~, or set a default speed multiplier for all videos and podcasts by setting the variable ~elfeed-time-speed-multiplier~.
** Technical Limitations
 * I haven't figured out a good way to determine how long it takes to read webcomics. Perhaps sort them into webcomics that publish chapters VS pages at a time? Or maybe try to measure it's length in inches and have a variable for inches per second?
 * Newsletters pose a similar problem, since they can have many links, and it's impossible to know which set of links you'll follow.
 * yt-dlp currently doesn't have a way to access the localized title of a video, see [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/387][this issue]].
** Epistemological Limitations
elfeed-time cannot account for time spent pondering, note-taking, cross-referencing, rereading, grappling with, examining, or otherwise thinking about entries.
